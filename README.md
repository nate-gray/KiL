# KiL
- Start by downloading the project
- When working on a new feature, create a new branch off of the develop branch
- Once a feature is completed, push the branch to this repo.
- Create a pull request for the new work into the develop branch.  Do not merge your own pull request.  This should be reviewed by someone else, and they will allow the merge into develop. 
- The develop branch will be used for testing features that we beleive are complete.  When we agree that the develop branch is in a stable state and should be merged, then we will merge it into master.
